### ACTION Alert

Last week, Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, state attorney general Lawrence Wasden and 9 other state attorneys general [signed a letter to Trump demanding that he end DACA](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/jun/30/otter-wasden-join-call-to-end-daca-program-for-dre/), a federal program that protects some immigrants, who arrived in the United States as children, from deportation.

According to the [Migration Policy Institute](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca-profiles), almost 3,400 Idahoans had applied for DACA by March. Around 6,000 Idahoans may be eligible. The program has made it possible for many Idaho residents to get jobs, finish college, and participate in community life without fear of deportation.

Otter's position on DACA, his opposition to other Obama-era immigration efforts, and his recent statements on refugee resettlement in Idaho, show a shocking lack of compassion for his constituents, a willful ignorance of U.S. and Idaho history, and represent an attack on the very fabric of our nation.

We will not let these threats go unanswered on this, our collective Independence Day.
 
On this 4th of July, in keeping with the theme of the 4th of July Liberty Day Parade in Boise — ** “The Good in America” ** —  the Idaho Organizing Project reminds Otter and Wasden that immigrants to this state ARE The Good in America!

**WHAT**: A 4th of July gathering to parade back to the politicians as they roll by!

**HOW**: Wear black shirts or caps and gowns if you are a student, recent student, immigrant or otherwise identify as a Dreamer! Bring signs about the positive contribution of immigrants, especially immigrant youth, on the USA and on the state.

**WHEN**: Meet at 10 am on Tuesday, July 4, 2017 to make signs and organize.

**WHERE**: South side of the Idaho Supreme Court, at Jefferson and 5th (try to bike or walk... parking will be difficult).
