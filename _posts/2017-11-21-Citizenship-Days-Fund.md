# [Idaho Organizing Project Citizenship Days Fund](https://bitly.com/iop-citizenship)

In 2016, the fee to apply for U.S. citizenship rose to $640 (plus an $85 biometric fee, totaling $725). For many of the 50,000 immigrants in Idaho who are eligible for citizenship, these application and legal fees pose an insurmountable barrier.

In the year since its inception, the Idaho Organizing Project has helped more than 100 Idahoans apply for U.S. citizenship through our Citizenship Days workshops in Nampa, Jerome and Hailey. We also provide financial assistance grants to applicants to defray the cost of the citizenship application.

ALL funds raised in this Crowdrise will go into our [citizenship grant fund](https://bitly.com/iop-citizenship), to help cover application fees for Idahoans who have come here from other countries and want to become U.S. citizens so that they can fully participate in the democratic process. Your donations will provide partial grants to applicants who demonstrate a financial need.

Applicants are assisted by a cadre of volunteers and attorneys who walk them through the entire application â€” from eligibility to addressing the envelope. Attorneys, led by Andrade Legal, a local law firm, provide pro-bono oversight and advising at every event. We also have volunteer and outreach support from Catholic Charities of Idaho, the Community Council of Idaho, The International Rescue Committee, The Mexican Consulate in Boise and the University of Idaho Immigration Law Clinic.

Our next Citizenship Day is December 16 in Caldwell. [Please donate before this date](https://bitly.com/iop-citizenship) so that we can help as many people as possible with their fees. We will have a full schedule of workshops in 2018 as well. 

Tax-exempt donations will be processed by our fiscal sponsor, The Fund For Idaho, Inc., at this link:[https://bitly.com/iop-citizenship](https://bitly.com/iop-citizenship)
