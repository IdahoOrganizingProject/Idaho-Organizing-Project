Jerome County Sheriff Doug McFall is in the final stages of making a deal to house ICE detainees in the new county jail, according to this <a href="http://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/jerome-looks-to-contract-with-feds-to-hold-immigration-suspects/article_bf6b0220-46e7-54cd-abdd-8ba53f2b05c7.html">*Times-News* article</a>. The Jerome County Commission will <a href="http://www.jeromecountyid.us/vertical/sites/%7B2423A997-F66F-4BAE-9896-858E67909C93%7D/uploads/JULY_3_AGENDA_revised.pdf">discuss immigration issues and may consider the deal</a> at its meeting at 9 a.m. on Monday, July 3 (the agenda item appears to be called "Immigration Public Relations Campaign.")

The Idaho Organizing Project is encouraging people to attend the Monday Commission meeting to tell Jerome County to **just say no to ICE in our communities**.

Here are:
### 10 Reasons to STOP ICE Setting Up Shop in the New Jerome County Jail

1. ICE uses local jails as a **dragnet** to expand its reach, to round up more people, and to gather more info on the community. With a permanent presence at the County Jail, immigration officers will be on site, will interact more frequently with local law enforecement and will troll inmates and their families.
2. There are no ICE detention facilities in Idaho at the moment. Having 50 ICE beds in Jerome -- that the feds pay for whether or not they are full -- sets up a huge **incentive for ICE** to fill those beds, to arrest more people, and to hold them longer.
3. That also means that if you are waiting to see an immigration judge, to post bond, for example, you will **have to wait longer** -- months longer -- before you can see a judge.
4. Counties and cities should not be holding inmates AT ALL for federal immigration authorities. Local law enforcement is **not beholden to federal immigration agency dictates**. Many police departments choose to police for ALL members of their communities, rather than targeting immigrants and people of color. This makes their jobs EASIER and makes the community SAFER.
5. Jerome is a major **hub of the Latino community** in Idaho. Jerome County is **33%** Latino, according the the U.S. Census Bureau. Bringing ICE into the local jail is a clear violation of the community's trust, spreads legitimate fear throughout the county, and ultimately hurts the county.
6. ICE is **bad for business** in the Magic Valley, where farms and dairies dominate the economy and where much of the workforce is undocumented.
7. Undocumented community members have many, **long-standing ties to the Magic Valley**, including U.S. citizen children and spouses, friends and neighbors with myriad immigration statuses, and roots in the cities and towns of the valley that go back a century or more.
8. ICE, local law enforcement and the County Commissioners **do not understand** that immigration status is a complex and fluid category, that non-citizens are some of our best citizens, or that brown skin is not reasonalble cause for search and siezure, as evidenced by recent emails to a constituent (see below).
9. The state Attorney Gerneal's Office is already investigating Jerome County Sheriff Doug McFall is [for misuse of county resources](http://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/former-jerome-sheriff-s-lieutenant-accused-of-taking-money-ag/article_208fee99-87c4-547d-bc52-51aea5c78eea.html) and one of his liutenants has resigned.
10. ICE has long been a **rogue government agency**, now run by the most anti-immigration forces in our nation, under the Trump administration.

Some quotes from **Jerome County Commissioner Roger Morley** in a note to a constituent:
> ...this is no different than our Sheriffâ€™s department going after white lawbreakers right here in our community and sending them to places where they will not pray [*sic*] on our population.

> The ICE officers responded that they are only going after the population, Hispanic or Bosnian, that are breaking the law and taking advantage of all of us.

> I can only hope you understand my position. I am not a bigot or do I condone discrimination.
